# Addon Icon

This addon needs a PNG icon file named `icon.png` (128x128 pixels) for Home Assistant.

You can:
1. Create your own 128x128 PNG icon
2. Use any PostgreSQL/database themed icon
3. Use a simple blue square with "MCP" text

For now, the addon will work without an icon, but it's recommended to add one for better visual identification in the Home Assistant UI.

## Suggested icon themes:
- PostgreSQL elephant logo
- Database/cylinder icon
- Blue background with "MCP" text
- Combination of database and communication symbols
