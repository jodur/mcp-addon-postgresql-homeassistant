### Files Updated:

1. **`src/auth/home-assistant-auth.ts`**
   - âœ… Updated to service-based authentication model
   - âœ… Removed `ALLOWED_USERS` dependency for long-lived tokens
   - âœ… Added JWT token parsing for service identification
   - âœ… Improved Home Assistant API integration
   - âœ… Added proper fallback handling

2. **`src/types.ts`**
   - âœ… Updated `UserContext` interface comments to reflect service context
   - âœ… Clarified that it represents service authentication, not user sessions

3. **`.env.example`**
   - âœ… Removed `ALLOWED_USERS` configuration
   - âœ… Updated comments to reflect service-based authentication
   - âœ… Set NODE_ENV to production for addon context

4. **`config.yaml`**
   - âœ… Removed `allowed_users` option from addon configuration
   - âœ… Removed `allowed_users` from schema validation
   - âœ… Simplified configuration for MCP service model

5. **`README.md`**
   - âœ… Updated documentation to reflect service-based authentication
   - âœ… Removed references to user-level access control
   - âœ… Added note about MCP service-to-service communication model

### Key Authentication Changes:

#### Before (User-Based):
```typescript
// Check if user is in allowed users list
return allowedUsers.includes(user.username) || allowedUsers.includes(user.userId);
```

#### After (Service-Based):
```typescript
// For long-lived tokens in MCP context, if the token is valid and write ops are enabled,
// the service has write permissions
return true;
```

### Environment Variables:

#### Removed:
- `ALLOWED_USERS` (not applicable for MCP servers)

#### Kept:
- `ENABLE_WRITE_OPERATIONS` (controls service capabilities)
- `HA_BASE_URL` (Home Assistant API endpoint)
- `DATABASE_URL` (PostgreSQL connection)

### Authentication Flow:

## ðŸš€ Ready for Deployment

The main Home Assistant addon now properly implements:

1. **Service-based authentication** appropriate for MCP servers
2. **Long-lived token support** with JWT parsing
3. **Home Assistant API integration** for token validation
4. **Simplified configuration** without user-level complexity
5. **Improved error handling** and fallback mechanisms

The addon is now aligned with the MCP protocol's service-to-service communication model and ready for production deployment in Home Assistant.
